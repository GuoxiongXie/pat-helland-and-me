Pat Helland and Me: How to build stateful distributed applications that can scale almost infinitely

## Abstract

In 2007, Pat Helland published [“Life Beyond Distributed Transactions: An Apostate’s Opinion,”](https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=3025012) in which he conducts a thought experiment on how to design a distributed database that can scale almost infinitely. While the paper explicitly addresses distributed database design, [Sean T. Allen](https://www.monkeysnatchbanana.com/) shows that the ideas are far more widely applicable, particularly in scaling stateful applications. Sean explores some of Helland’s ideas through practical examples from his experience building data processing systems using tools like Apache Storm and, more recently, developing a stateful distributed stream processor at [Wallaroo Labs](https://www.wallaroolabs.com/).
